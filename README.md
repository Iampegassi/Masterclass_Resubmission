# Masterclass_Resubmission
This study conducts a comparative analysis of facial expression classification models, focusing on evaluating their performance and identifying biases. Results reveal that DenseNet and ResNet outperform CNN in facial expression classification on the same  AffectNet dataset. DenseNet achieves the highest testing accuracy (80.00%), closely followed by ResNet (80.00%), while CNN trails with 60.00%. Additionally, DenseNet exhibits the lowest average test loss (0.5984), indicating superior error minimization compared to ResNet (1.0185) and CNN (2.4851). By systematically comparing these classification models, this research aims to illuminate their strengths, weaknesses, and potential biases in the context of emotion recognition tasks using the "AffectNet" dataset
